Face Processing Python Program
Overview
This Python program, named "face_processing.py," is designed for processing facial images using computer vision techniques. The code includes functionalities such as gamma correction, skin color thresholding, and finding local minima in the luminance histogram. The program operates on image files in the BMP format and utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing.

Contents
The main components of the program include:

Gamma Correction:

The program performs gamma correction on the input images to enhance or adjust their luminance. This is achieved by converting the image to the LUV color space and applying a power transformation to the luminance channel.
Skin Color Thresholding:

The code includes a method for extracting skin regions from the input images based on specific color thresholding criteria. This is useful for isolating facial features in the images.
Histogram Analysis:

The program analyzes the luminance histogram of the images to identify local minima. This is done using a convolution operation with a predefined kernel to detect significant changes in luminance values.
Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including OpenCV and NumPy.
Run the program by executing the "face_processing.py" script in a Python environment.
Provide input images in BMP format, and the program will perform the specified facial image processing.
Dependencies
OpenCV
NumPy
Make sure to install these dependencies before running the program.

Notes
The program assumes input images are in BMP format.
Adjust parameters such as gamma values based on specific requirements.
Experiment with the code and parameters to achieve desired facial image processing results.
